textgrouping
================

A library to group texts that has patterns by recognizing their patterns.

Development Status
--------------------

It's already pretty much what I want. It's well javadoc'ed and has 97% coverage. Just dive in if you need it.

The guess regex part isn't implemented and I guess it's not that useful in the end. Just group the text automatically and let human do the rest, like expanding the parts that should be recognized as variable but not as fixed pattern.
